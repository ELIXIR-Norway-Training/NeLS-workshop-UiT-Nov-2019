# NeLS-workshop-UiT-Nov-2019

ELIXIR Norway: Hands-on bioinformatics NeLS workshop

University of Tromsø

Tuesday 26th November 09.00-15.00

## Description
We are pleased to announce the second hands-on bioinformatics NeLS workshop organised in Tromsø by ELIXIR Norway (https://www.elixir-norway.org/).  The topic is on how you can use the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS) (nels.bioinfo.no) to store and share data, and to run analyses via customisable analysis workflows in Galaxy. More specifically, we will go through how you can store data in NeLS and upload it directly into Galaxy. We will also construct and run a complete sequence analysis workflow for taxonomic profiling on a metagenomic sample.  There are no requirements for programming skills or experience using the command line, as Galaxy provides a web interface for running analysis.

## Teachers:
- Erik Hjerde, University of Tromsø
- Ståle Nygård, University of Oslo
- Nils Peder Willassen, University of Tromsø
